## 1. High-level overview of JavaScript

JavaScript is a language that is:

-  **High-level:** JavaScript is a high-level language, which means that it is very close to human languages. It is easy to read and write. It is also easy to understand.
-  **Garbage-collected:** means that it automatically frees up memory when it is no longer needed. This is a huge advantage over languages like C, where you have to manually free up memory.
-  **Interpreted / Just-in-time compiled:** means that it does not need to be compiled before it is executed.
-  **Multi-paradigm:** In programing, paradigm is an approach and mindset of structuring code, which will direct the coding style and techniques. Sound abstract, right? Now, three most popular paradigms are:
   -  **Procedural:** It's just oganizing code into functions. It's good for small and simple projects.
   -  **Object-oriented:** In object-oriented programming, the program is viewed as a collection of objects that interact with one another. Each object contains data, in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. The main focus of object-oriented programming is on the objects. It is good for large and complex projects.
   -  **Functional programming:** In functional programming, the program is viewed as a mathematical function. The main focus of functional programming is on the evaluation of functions. It is good for large and complex projects.
-  **Prototype-based:** have you ever wondered why we can create an array and then use the push method on it, for example? Well, it's because of prototypal inheritance. Basically, we create arrays from an array blueprint, which is like a template and this is called the prototype. This prototype contains all the array methods and the arrays that we create in our code then inherit the methods from the blueprint so that we can use them on the arrays.
-  **First-class functions**: means that functions are just treated like any other variable. We can pass functions into other functions and return functions from functions. We can also call methods on functions. This is a very powerful feature and it is one of the reasons why JavaScript is so popular.
-  **Dynamically typed:** means that we do not have to manually define the data types of our variables. Instead, data types are determined automatically. This is also a very powerful feature because it saves us a lot of time and makes our code more flexible.
-  **Single-threaded:** means that one command is executed at a time. The next command cannot be executed until the previous command has finished. This is also a very powerful feature because it makes our code more predictable and easier to debug.
-  **Non-blocking:** means that if some time-consuming task is being executed, the JavaScript engine can continue executing other, simpler tasks in the meantime. This is also a very powerful feature because it makes our code more responsive.
