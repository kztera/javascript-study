<h1> HTML - CSS Crash Course </h1>

_In fact, I really hate CSS. But I have to learn it and it's gonna be helpful (I hope so). So I decided to make a repo about it although everything you will read in here is very basic. Just enough to familiar with the syntax and concepts. I hope it will help you too if you are a beginner like me. (´▽`ʃ♡ƪ)_
